# GMU_IT315
Swift files for IT 315 (iOS Mobile Development)
These are all the projects I worked on for my iOS mobile development class at George Mason University. These projects are no longer being maintained and are for portfolio use only.

## Tip Calculator
iOS app that calculates percentage tips from subtotals.
Taught me basic Swift programming using variables and arithmetic operations.

## Random Fortune
iOS app that gives the user a random fortune telling message.
Taught me how to generate random numbers through Swift methods and use arrays with said numbers.

## Hiking Trail
iOS app that allows the user to choose a specific hiking trail that's listed and pull information about that trail, such as length and difficulty.
Taught me how to create and link different views and allow the user to choose from a list of hiking trails stored in an array.

## Animal Facts
iOS final project app that allows the user to choose from a list of animals and view interesting facts and information about said animal. For example, the user can choose to view the animals habitat and have the app pull up an Apple Maps window to drop a pin on the habitat's location on the world view.
This project was a culmination of all the fundamental iOS/Swift development concepts taught throughtout the course as well as a combination of all previous app projects.
