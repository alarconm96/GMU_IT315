//03/08/2022
// - Bring up a trail on start up.
// --- Refactoring (we will refactor a method)
// - Add values to our objects
// -- Adding the Web Site
// - Images (static)
// - User Defaults. to store values that one can access across app restarts
// - Motion - Shake Gesture (animaions closoure)
// - Launch Screen
// - Sound




// 1) Create a Swift file for a Hiking Trail Class
// 2) Add properties to the class - TrailName, TrailDescription, TrailLength
// 3) create an array of Hiking Trail Objects
// 4) create five hikingTrail object and add it to the array
// 5) Randomly select one of the objects from the array
// 6) show the value on the label.
